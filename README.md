# DataCenterExperiments
This contains data center experiments codes written in Julia. 

All the stochastic processes are assumed to be non-Poisson.

# Directory description

DeterministicProblem: Solving a deterministic nonlinear network optimization problem for a data center

SimStationary: Simulating a data center where jobs are arrived by stationary stochastic processes (arrival rate is constant)

SimNonstationary: Simulating a data center where jobs are arrived by nonstationary stochastic processes (arrival rate is time-varying)
