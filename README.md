# DataCenterExperiments
This contains data center experiments codes written in Julia.

DeterministicProblem: Solving a deterministic nonlinear network optimization problem for data center

SimStationary: Simulating a data center where jobs are arrived by stationary stochastic processes (arrival rate is constant)

SimNonstationary: Simulating a data center where jobs are arrived by nonstationary stochastic processes (arrival rate is time-varying)
