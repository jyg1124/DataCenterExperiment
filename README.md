# DataCenterExperiments
This contains data center experiments codes written in Julia. 

Stochastic processes are assumed to be non-Poisson.

## DeterministicProblem:
Solving a deterministic nonlinear network optimization problem for a data center

## SimStationary:
Simulating a data center where jobs are arrived by stationary stochastic processes (arrival rate is constant)

## SimNonstationary:
Simulating a data center where jobs are arrived by nonstationary stochastic processes (arrival rate is time-varying)
